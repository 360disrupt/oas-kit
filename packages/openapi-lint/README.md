# openapi-lint

This is a plugin for [openapi-parser](https://github.com/mermade/openapi-kit) which implements a simple linter and a set of default rules.

If you need a more fully featured linter CLI, check out [speccy](https://github.com/wework/speccy) which is based on the same parser/validator and plugin technology.
